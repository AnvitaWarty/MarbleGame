# MarbleGame
This program is a marble game that implements a circular linked list.  The user has a finite set of marbles. Once the user decides to play the game, the program will randomly select marbles of four possible colors: red, yellow, green, and blue.  At any point during the game, if the user manages to get four marbles of the same color or they reach the maximum of 20 "picked" marbles, the game will end.  If the user gets 4 of the same marble colors, the value of that color, multiplied by four, will be their final score.
